This is a project for the HeroHackII hackathon hosted my MLH(Major Hacking League). The Goal of this app is to create a web app the can assist users with managing their medicines. The app is called Medihelp and helps users by providing the following services: A drug serach up where users can lookup there medicines to find out more info about the drug, (More features to be added at a later date). Medihelp is a fullstack webapp that runs using node.js, express.js, and MongoDB along with the usual html/css/js. Uses bootstrap 5 to help style the front end and a demo of the app is hosted on Heroku. Visit the following link to see and use the demo : (link goes here).
